# python_challenge
Module 3
## Project Description
Project includes two programs. One (PyPoll) that can parse through election data in .csv format and summarize/find the winning elector candidate, and the second one (PyBank) can summarize an earnings report from data in a .csv file.
## Execution
File requires to be put into folder with two folders, Resources and output. Raw .csv file must be put into Resources and the data summary will output into the output folder. 
## Features
File features .csv reader and writer, python loops through .csv file using dictionaries and lists, and two python modules (os and csv). 
## Contributors
EdX class code examples were used for almost the entire project. However, format code was used from an outside website to best display percentages using: format(example ".2%") (https://pythonmldaily.com/posts/python-show-number-as-percentage-with-format-and-f-string). 
Also, to make the terminal easier to read, "/n" was found online and used in PyPoll (https://discuss.python.org/t/use-newlines-n-with-the-command-python-c/20099)
Lastly, class tutor services were used to simplify code/remove redundancies.
